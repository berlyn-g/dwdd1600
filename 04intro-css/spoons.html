        <h1>About the Business</h1>
        <p>Hello, I am a 21 year old girl who loves <strong>hand making rings</strong> out of antique spoons that I collect. I grew up going to antique stores with my mom and I continue going with her to this day. I have always had a love for rings so I decided to start my own small business to pursue that passion!</p>
        
        <h2>Spoon Rings</h2>
        <p>A spoon ring is a ring made from the handle of a spoon, a type of jewelry that originated in 17th century England. Spoon rings are a symbol of love and commitment, and are often made from silver or other solid silver alloys.</p>
        
        <h2>Send Me Your Spoon</h2>
        <p>If you have a special spoon you would love as your own spoon ring <a href="products.html#eb">send it to me</a>, I will happily made your very own spoon ring our of a spoon you already own. This will also be at a cheaper price!</p>
        
        <h2>Different Rings</h2>
        <p><strong>Different</strong> types of spoons ring designs</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Classic Band</li>
            <li>Spiral Twist</li>
            <li>Whole Spoon</li>
        </ol>
        <p>There are a couple different ways you can bend a spoon into a ring. These different designs require different ways of bending and twisting the spoon. When deciding how you want your ring to look on your finger it is important to do your <em>research</em>.</p>
        
        <dl>
            <dt>Classic Band</dt>
            <dd>These are the classic ring band most rings look like</dd>
            <dt>Spiral Twist</dt>
            <dd>These almost look like two rings on your finger the way it wraps around</dd>
            <dt>Whole Spoon</dt>
            <dd>Depending on the spoon you have you can actually use the whole spoon the pend into a ring.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Difference between the making of each ring</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Classic bend is going to be the easiest ring because it does not require any twisting of the metal</li>
            <li>Spiral rings require much more twisting and maneuvering. You will need to almost stretch the spoon out to be able to wrap it around one more time.</li>
            <li>When choosing this type of ring you will need a but smaller ring. You will also have to flatten out the bowl part of the spoon. After that you bend it as usual but will need to be carful when it starts to overlap.</li>
        </ul>
