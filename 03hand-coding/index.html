         <h1>About the Business</h1> 
        <p>Hello, I am a 21 year old girl who loves <strong>hand making rings</strong> out of antique spoons that I collect. I grew up going to antique stores with my mom and I continue going with her to this day. I have always had a love for rings so I decided to start my own small business to pursue that passion!</p>
             
        <p><a href="rings.html#sign">How they're made</a> for <em>hand made spoon rings</em>, First, pick an existing ring that fits the finger you want the spoon ring to fit, alternatively, you could use a set of THESE, then find a socket  that is a snug fit around the inside of the ring, once you find the correct size socket, measure the circumference of it with a tape measure (the cloth type works best) and cut the handle to that length with the wire cutters/tin snips. use a file to round out the edges.This step can sometimes be hard, depending on the spoon being used. first, take the spoon and lay it on the socket. use a piece of heave fabric to cover it to prevent scratches, and hold with pliers then slowly bend it around the socket. now carefully tap the end flush with the hammer. After you finish bending the ring all the way arounf to fit your finger depending on how old your spoon if feel free to polish it up to make it nice and shiney so it can look brand new.</p>
